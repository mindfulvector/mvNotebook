<h1>Hey there! I'm <i>mindfulvector</i> and this is <i>mvNotebook</i>!</h1>

This is a simple notebook program for managing your projects, taking notes, etc.

Each Notebook tab above is a directory under Documents\mvNotebook. Each one can contain unlimited pages, which are saved as HTML files on disk.

It currently can switch between 10 notebooks, auto saves every 5 minutes as well as on tab change or page change, and on close. Rich text formatting is fairly robust, and accessed by selecting a piece of text then using the popup.

Additional features will be added soon, such as file exporting, syncronization, and more.

<h2>Building the source</h2>

Uou can build the project yourself using Delphi 11+ for **free**! If you don't know about Delphi but think this is a cool program you might have fun getting to learn this system. I can't guarantee you will be able to build the program without modification without buying third party addons. I don't really track exactly what I use to make each program and this information is boilerplate to some extent until people actually start trying to do this, then I'll updated it! In particular this program (mvNotebook) does used a paid extension called HTML Components for delphi.

I do also use a paid version of Delphi but you may be able to build most of the code with the free [Delphi Community Edition](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi/starter/free-download).

If you have any trouble doing that, let me know and I will try to help!
