This is the first notebook in the…nnsNotebook program.

Each Notebook is a directory, currently with one page inside it: Page1.html

Next feature to implement is multiple pages per notebook.

It currently can switch between 10 notesbooks, auto saves every 5 minutes as well as on tab change and on close.

And I got a cute Icon from Icon8 for it
